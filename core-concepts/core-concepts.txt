K8 CORE CONCEPTS
----------------

MASTER : Manage, schedule, plan, monitor nodes
      - kube scheduler : decides on which node to put the pod,like a crane. Rank nodes, filter nodes.
      - etcd cluster : databse of keyname and value, like the database for the master.
      - controller manager : Monitors nodes health/stauts, remidiate situation, node monitor period, node monitor grace period, and then POD eviction timeout.  
      - kube-apiserver : which we use to use and over see different functions of the MASTER, Authenticate users, udpate etcd, validate requests, retrieve data.
      
WORKER : Host applications as containers.
      - Kubelet : Like the caption of the ship, communicates with the master nodes, loading unloading of cotainers(apps), registers the node in the cluster.
                  When it receives the order to load a pod or app, it requests the container runtime (DOCKER) to pull the require image and run an instance.
      - Kube-proxy : runs on each node, looks for new services. and creates rules on each node to forward traffic to that services. This is a virtual networking                       solution for pods to communicate between each other. Uses IP TABLE rules.
      - Kubectl :  kubectl is a client for the Kubernetes API, kubectl is your cockpit to control Kubernetes.
      - PODS : the smallest unit of a Kubernetes application, a pod encapsulates the cointainer(app) nad its helper app.
